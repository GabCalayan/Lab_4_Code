# Lab_4_Code
 
What is this project about? 
    This project is about visualizing the collision point data under a hex - grid layer from turf.js such that we can figure out which hexagon areas have the highest "COUNT" of collisions (whether it be pedestrian, biking, or vehicular). As stated in the Lab 4 document "Hexbin maps can help to reduce bias produced by usual choropleth maps...". 

Data source: 
    Toronto Police Service Public Safety Data Portal 

What I have attempted and completed: 
    - All code relating to the creation of the bounding box and hexbin. 
    - All code relating to showing and visualizing the collision point data 
    - The comments and code relating to the turf.collect for the collision point data under the hexbins 
    - The code relating to simple map controls, like search bar, and zoom control option. 

What I have not completed: 
    - Finalizing the map relating to:
        - Legend 
        - Paint properties of the hexbin 
        - Created the pop - ups but the COUNT come up as undefined 
        - Was planning to create the visibility check layer box but didn't complete it
